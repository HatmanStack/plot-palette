        Create a dialogue between two characters in this scenario:

        **Scenario:** {{ scenario }}

        **Characters:**
        1. **{{ character1.name }}**: {{ character1.personality }}
        2. **{{ character2.name }}**: {{ character2.personality }}

        Write 8-12 exchanges that:
        - Reveal each character's unique personality through their speech patterns
        - Use natural, realistic dialogue (not overly formal or theatrical)
        - Include subtext and implied meanings
        - Show character dynamics and relationships
        - Advance the scenario meaningfully
        - Include appropriate reactions, pauses, and emotions
        - Demonstrate how their different personalities create tension or harmony

        Format as:
        **CHARACTER NAME:** dialogue text

        Show, don't tell - let the dialogue reveal character rather than describing it.
